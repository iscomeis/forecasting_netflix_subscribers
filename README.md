# 📊 Time Series Forecasting for Netflix Subscribers 📈

In this project, we delve into the world of **Netflix subscriber trends** by applying various time series forecasting models to predict future subscriber growth. With the explosive growth of online streaming services, **accurate forecasting** is critical for understanding **subscriber patterns**, optimizing marketing strategies, and making data-driven business decisions.

To make our forecasts, we explore and implement several classic and modern forecasting models, including:

1. **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA)** 🌦️  
   An extension of ARIMA that accounts for seasonal variations and cyclical trends in the data.

2. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** 🔄  
   A popular method used to forecast time series data by capturing autocorrelations and trends. 

3. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** 💡  
   A fundamental technique to smooth data and identify trends over a period.
   
4. **Prophet** 📅  
   A forecasting tool developed by Facebook that handles missing data and seasonal effects, widely used in business for time series predictions.

Additionally, we explore key concepts such as **Autocorrelation** 🔍, which identifies the relationship between the current and past values, and **Seasonal Decomposition** 🌱, which helps to break down the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals to better understand the underlying patterns.
